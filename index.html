                <h2>What is bouldering?</h2>
                <p>Bouldering is a form of free climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. While bouldering can be done without any equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and to provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually less than six metres (20 ft) tall.</p>

                <h2>Why do I love bouldering?</h2>
                <p>I do a form of bouldering that is indoors, otherwise called indoor climbing. It's <b>great for beginners</b> as you can rent shoes and find the easy climbs, as when indoors the different climbs are all labelled by difficulty, usually with different colours.</p>
                <p>It's also incredibly <b>social</b>, and I often go with groups of friends or climbing groups which is a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>Climbing is a sport that uses lots of brain power, since the moves can be highly technical and it can take quite a few tries to complete a climb. I find the <b>problem-solving</b> invigorating.</p>

                    <h3>A free-soloer</h3>
                    <div class="text1" id="1">
                      <p>Alexander Honnold (born August 17, 1985) is an American rock climber best known for his free solo ascents of big walls. Honnold rose to prominence in June 2017 when he became the first person to free solo El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, a feat that sports writer Daniel Duane described as "one of the great athletic feats of any kind, ever." Honnold also holds the record for the fastest ascent of the Yosemite triple crown, an 18-hour, 50-minute link-up of Mount Watkins, The Nose, and the Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome. In 2015, he won a Piolet d'Or for the Moonwalk Traverse in Patagonia with Tommy Caldwell.
                        Honnold is the author (with David Roberts) of the memoir Alone on the Wall (2015) and the subject of the 2018 biographical documentary Free Solo (trailer found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urRVZ4SW7WU">here</a>), which won a BAFTA and an Academy Award.</p>

                    <h3>A big wall / traditional climber</h3>
                    <div class="text3" id="3">
                      <p>Tommy Caldwell (born August 11, 1978) is an American rock climber who has set records in sport climbing, traditional climbing, and in big-wall climbing. Caldwell made the first free ascents of several major routes on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.
                        He made the first ascents of some of the hardest sport climbing routes in the U.S., including Kryptonite with grade of 5.14c/d, and the world's first 9a+/b  route, Flex Luthor, at the Fortress of Solitude, Colorado in 2003. In January 2015, Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson completed the first free climb of the Dawn Wall of El Capitan. At the time, their 19-day ascent was considered one of the hardest big wall free ascents in history.
                        In 2015, National Geographic called Caldwell "arguably the best all-around rock climber on the planet", and he is an important figure in the history of the sport.</p>
