Hobby Page - Bouldering  
This site is an informative page about bouldering and other types of climbing.  It contains HTML (for the website), CSS (for the styling of the website) and JavaScript(for the up to date time on the page). 

Planning, Building and Debugging
Some challenges faced whilst making this was using and combining all these languages since it was my first time using them. I also struggled with getting the boxes to line up and the pictures being of different sizes also not lining up properly but I found appropriate solutions.

Table of Contents  
The page is divided into several sections, including:  
"What is bouldering?" - an explanation of bouldering and the equipment used.  
"Why is climbing good for you?" - a bullet point list of physical and mental health benefits of climbing.  
"Why do I like bouldering?" - a section that explains my favourite things about climbing/bouldeirng.  
"Famous climbers" - a section that includes biographical information and links to documentaries about famous climbers.  

How to use  
To view the webpage, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The page is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes, so it can be viewed on a variety of devices. To navigate to a specific section, click on the corresponding title in the header. For more information about climbing spots in Manchester, refer to the contact information in the footer.
