# Bouldering Page
Hobby Page - Bouldering  
This site is an informative page about bouldering and other types of climbing.  It contains HTML (for the website), CSS (for the styling of the website) and JavaScript(for the up to date time on the page). 
This is also the first page I ever built using HTML, CSS and JS!

Planning, Building and Debugging  
I planned to create my sections in blocks with a colouring climbing image as the background since I had seen a website with this structure and thought it looked nice and unique. I chose blue and yellow as the theme colours of this page.  
Some challenges faced whilst making this was using and combining all these languages since it was my first time using them. I also struggled with getting the boxes to line up and the pictures being of different sizes also not lining up properly but I found appropriate solutions.

Table of Contents  
The page is divided into several sections, including:  
"What is bouldering?" - an explanation of bouldering and the equipment used.  
"Why is climbing good for you?" - a bullet point list of physical and mental health benefits of climbing.  
"Why do I love bouldering?" - a section that explains my favourite things about climbing/bouldeirng.  
"Famous climbers" - a section that includes biographical information and links to documentaries about famous climbers.  

How to use  
To view the webpage, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The page is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes, so it can be viewed on a variety of devices.
